# crypto

The crypto package contains primitives used throughout the project.  It includes
implementations of several timelock puzzle schemes and utilities for producing
cryptographic proofs.

## Proof of Assets

The `provisions` subpackage implements a privacy preserving proof of reserves
protocol.  The exchange commits to the balance of each owned address and then
publishes a Pedersen commitment to the sum of all balances.  Third parties can
challenge the exchange to open individual commitments which proves that the
aggregate commitment matches the onâ€‘chain funds without revealing the complete
set of addresses.
